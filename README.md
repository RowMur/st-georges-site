# St Georges TTC Website

### Project Description

Having not been touched in years, my local table tennis club's website has been in need of a spruce up. This work aims to encourage new people to come along to the club, and hopefully to take up the sport as a hobby longer term. To achieve this I have:

- Answered major questions as quickly as possible when a visitor comes onto the site as concisely as possible. Who, what, when, where...
- Used a modern design to bring some life to the site and hence the club.
- Implemented a contact form into the site to reduce the friction of reaching out to the club.
